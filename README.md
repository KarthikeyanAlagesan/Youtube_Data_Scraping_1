# Youtube_Data_Scraping_1
# Project Introduction:

* To create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels.

# Tools and libraries used this project :
* Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language.

* YouTube Data API: Utilizes the official YouTube Data API to interact with YouTube's platform and retrieve data.

* Streamlit: The user interface and visualization are created using the Streamlit framework, providing a seamless and interactive experience.

* MongoDB: The collected data can be stored in a MongoDB database for efficient data management and querying.

* PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system used to store and manage the retrieved data.

* PyMongo: A Python library that enables interaction with MongoDB, a NoSQL database. It is used for storing and retrieving data from MongoDB in the YouTube 
  Data Scraper.

* Psycopg2: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python that allows seamless integration between Python and PostgreSQL. It enables the YouTube Data Scraper to connect to and interact with the PostgreSQL database.

* Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. Pandas is used in the YouTube Data Scraper to handle and process data obtained from YouTube, providing functionalities such as data filtering, transformation, and aggregation.

* pip install -r requirements.txt: To install the required dependencies.* Python
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* Plotly
* Seaborn

# Approach :
* Set up a Streamlit app
* Connect to the YouTube API
* Store data in a MongoDB data lake
* Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse
* Query the SQL data warehouse
* Display data in the Streamlit app

# Conclusion
* This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a MongoDB database, migrates it to a SQL data warehouse, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.
